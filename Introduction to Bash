# Bash Automation

## **What is Bash?**
- **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** is a command-line interface and scripting language.
- It is used for automating tasks, file management, and executing system commands.

## **Real-Life Example: Automating Backups**
- Suppose you have an important file, **"report.txt"**, that you update daily.
- Instead of manually creating backups, you can use Bash to automate it.
- This prevents accidental data loss by keeping timestamped backups.

## **Why Use Bash?**
✅ **Saves time** by automating repetitive tasks  
✅ **Reduces human errors** in file management  
✅ **Useful for** system monitoring, backups, and automation
